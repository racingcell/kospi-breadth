The KOSPI market breadth shows that 25.18% of stocks are above their 20-day moving average, 36.62% are above the 60-day, 39.66% above the 120-day, and 48.90% above the 200-day moving average. This indicates a weak short-term trend with only a quarter of stocks showing strength relative to their recent performance. In terms of long-term alignment, nearly half of the stocks are above their 200-day moving average, suggesting some stability in the longer-term trend.

However, market participation quality appears low, with a significant number of stocks struggling to maintain upward momentum. According to Mark Minervini's CANSLIM methodology, the current conditions do not favor breakouts, as the percentage of stocks above key moving averages is insufficient to indicate a strong market environment for new investments. Overall, the market sentiment leans towards caution, indicating it may not be an optimal time for breakouts.
